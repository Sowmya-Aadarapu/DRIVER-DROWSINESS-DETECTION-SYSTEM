# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Drowsiness can be captured by detecting the eye blinks and percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS). For eye blink detection, propose a method which learned the pattern of duration of eyelid closed. According to, ‘this proposed method measures the time for a person closed their eyes and if they are closed longer than the normal eye blink time, it is possible that the person is falling asleep’. ‘The average of a normal person eye blink is nearly 310.3ms’. PERCLOS method proposes that drowsiness is measured by calculating the percentage of the eyelid ‘droops’. Sets of eye open and eye closed have been stored in the software library to be used as a parameter to differentiate either the eyes is fully open or fully closed. For eyelid to droops, it happened in much slower time as the person is slowly falling asleep. Hence, the transition of the driver’s drowsy can be recorded. Thus, PERCLOS method put a proportional value where when the eyes is 80% closed, which it is nearly to fully close, it assumed that the driver is drowsy.
