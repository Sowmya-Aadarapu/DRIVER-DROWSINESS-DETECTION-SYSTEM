# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Drowsiness can be captured by detecting the eye blinks and percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS). For eye blink detection, propose a method which learned the pattern of duration of eyelid closed. According to, â€˜this  This project focuses on a driver drowsiness detection system in automotive vehicles. The driver behavior is noticed in many conditions such as wearing spectacles and also in dark conditions inside the vehicle. The proposed system will be continuously monitoring the retina of the driver and all the monitored signals are sent to the microcontroller. The system is capable of detecting the drowsiness condition within the duration of more than 15 seconds.After the detection of abnormal behavior, it is alerted to the driver through alarms which reduces the accidents due to drowsiness of the driver.
